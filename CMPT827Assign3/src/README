||______________||

These instructions are intended for any Linux installation.

Ensure that you change which encoding you wish to produce within JavaMain.java in the invocation of createEncodings 
(i.e. cnfEncoding2D, cnfEncoding3D, smarterClauses).

Also make sure that you have installed the minisat package.

In the shell:
1. Type: ’javac JavaMain.java’.
2. Type: ’chmod 777 ./outputter.sh’ (gives permissions to the script)
3. Type: ’./outputter.sh’ (will produce output for all problem instances)
4. Move the produced .cnf files to the appropriate folder (i.e. 2D, 3D, smart)
5. Based on what encoding you chose, type:
	(a) ’chmod 777 ./runsat2D.sh’
	(b) ’chmod 777 ./runsat3D.sh’
	(c) ’chmod 777 ./runsatsmart.sh’
6. Based on what encoding you chose, type:
	(a) ’./runsat2D.sh’ (runs minisat on 2D encodings)
	(b) ’./runsat3D.sh’
	(c) ’./runsatsmart.sh’
